Foundational DevOps Concepts
What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality application continuously.

## Core Principles of DevOps:

Collaboration: Breaks silos between development and operations teams.

Automation: Automates repetitive processes to improve efficiency and consistency.

Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD): Enables rapid and reliable software releases.

Monitoring & Feedback: Ensures performance, reliability, and continuous improvement.

##DevOps Lifecycle Stages

Planning:
This stage involves gathering business requirements, defining goals, identifying risks, and creating a roadmap. Stakeholders from development, operations, and business teams collaborate to ensure alignment on expectations, timelines, and deliverables.

Development:
Code is written and reviewed collaboratively using tools like Git. Developers follow coding standards, write unit tests, and ensure code modularity and reusability. Agile practices such as sprints and standups often support this stage to enhance productivity and adaptability.

Building:
Convert source code into executable packages; automated builds validate integration.

Testing:
Automated and manual testing is performed to validate functionality, performance, and security. This includes unit tests, integration tests, regression tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Testing early and often reduces the likelihood of bugs reaching production.

Release:
Prepare the tested software for deployment with proper versioning and documentation.

Deployment:
Deliver code to production or staging environments using automated pipelines.

Operations:
Post-deployment, the operations team manages infrastructure, configuration, and resource provisioning. They ensure system reliability, scalability, and uptime by applying infrastructure-as-code (IaC), monitoring, and logging practices..

Monitoring:
Continuous monitoring tools track application performance, user behavior, and system health. Alerts and analytics help teams identify and resolve issues proactively, enabling continuous feedback and improvement throughout the lifecycle.
