Foundational DevOps Concepts
What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality application continuously.

## Core Principles of DevOps:

Collaboration: Breaks silos between development and operations teams.

Automation: Automates repetitive processes to improve efficiency and consistency.

Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD): Enables rapid and reliable software releases.

Monitoring & Feedback: Ensures performance, reliability, and continuous improvement.

##DevOps Lifecycle Stages

Planning:
Define project scope, gather requirements, and outline deliverables.

Development:
Write and manage code collaboratively using version control systems like Git.

Building:
Convert source code into executable packages; automated builds validate integration.

Testing:
Run automated/manual tests to detect bugs early and ensure quality.

Release:
Prepare the tested software for deployment with proper versioning and documentation.

Deployment:
Deliver code to production or staging environments using automated pipelines.

Operations:
Manage infrastructure, scalability, and performance post-deployment.

Monitoring:
Track application health, user activity, and system metrics for proactive issue resolution.
